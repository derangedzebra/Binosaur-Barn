# Binosaur Barn - Small and Unrestrained V1

This is the upgraded design that is installed at [Mori Point](https://goo.gl/maps/wpSysAgYLS7mhGZ39). It is meant to be attached to a thin metal pole using two pipe clamps. The binoculars inside are meant to be taken and returned, not restrained.

The design can be flipped horizontally if the position of the post needs to be swapped.

Version "b" is designed without the side mount, instead, it uses large pipe clamps for attachment to large fence posts or wire fencing.
